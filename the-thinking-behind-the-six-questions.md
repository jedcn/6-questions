# The Thinking Behind The 6 Questions

## Big Picture

The six questions create:

1. A self review
2. A manager review (of an employee)
3. Upward feedback (to the manager)

The monthly cadence causes these "reviews" to not be too far apart and
consequently not too big.

Each area of feedback includes a positive question and a question that will
reveal an opportunity for improvement. This is true for both employee and
manager.

## Why just one thing? Staying focused.

The terms "one thing" or "one way" appear in each of the questions. The
questions are intentionally limited to a single topic to avoid overloading
someone with too much feedback. The intent is to find "the most important
thing" to work on and work on that.

## How to get started? Start small.

When it comes to opportunities for growth, start with a small ask, verify that
change happens within a month, and then increase the size of your goals as it
makes sense.

If progress is not made, talk about what happened, and consider trying again or picking a different idea for growth.

## What to expect? Gradual growth and trust.

If you start with small asks and grow together, you will deliver feedback at a
regular cadence and learn how to work with each other.

Everyone benefits from regular check-ins, getting clear feedback without
surprises, and deliberate work to get better.

## What message are you sending? Commitment.

This process happens more regularly and takes more effort than a traditional
review every 6 or 12 months. That said, what it shows is that you, as a
manager:

1. Are committed to giving and receiving feedback on a regular basis
2. Give feedback that is "not all good" and "not all bad"
3. Give feedback in a format that is not confusing, not surpising, and unlikely
   to be misinterpted
4. Regularly tell an individual that you appreciate the good work they are
   doing
5. Regularly tell an individual that there is always room to grow (both for
   them and for yourself)
